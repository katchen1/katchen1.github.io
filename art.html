      <p>
        To me, art is autobiographical; it blends my feelings, visions, and intellectual interests 
        into expressions shared with my viewers. I am particularly intrigued by sculptures due to 
        the breath of materials I can play with, from Styrofoam and clay to paper cups and wires. My 
        sculptures have been influenced by contemporary artists such as Tony Cragg. For example, his public 
        installation <i>Points of View</i>, composed of stacked and twisted horizontal layers, inspired 
        me to craft my sculptures <i>Sprint</i>, <i>Infinite Loop</i>, and <i>Violin Variations</i> with 
        a sense of movement. By probing into novel techniques, merging media boundaries, and integrating 
        my multifaceted thoughts, I strive to render artwork that grants me a voice to deliver my perspectives 
        to the world, as if I am composing my own rhapsody.

          <p>An era of artificial intelligence is impending, and I am excited to see how autonomous devices can enhance our experiences in 
            daily life. By extracting components from recycled electronic devices, for example, antennas and curcuit boards from telephones 
            and keyboards, and rearranging them to form a futuristic person playing a violin, I juxtaposed the technicality of electric wares 
            and the expressiveness of music to reveal my imagination and hopes for the future.

          <p><i><b>Date:</b> December 2016</i></p>
          <p><i><b>Materials:</b> Plexiglass, Wood, Light Tube</i></p>
          <p><i><b>Dimensions:</b> W 39.0" x D 9.0" x H 9.0"</i></p>
          <p>Born at the turn of the millenium, in the year of the Dragon, I've always had a deep connection with 
            the idea of the Chinese dragon, which stemmed from animalistic beliefs thousands of years ago. This 
            sculpture celebrates the history of the calligraphic Dragon and illustrates a cross of my interests 
            in technology, math, calligraphy, and art. I extracted 99 forms of the Chinese calligraphic character of 
            Dragon, imprinting them onto acrylic boards using a laser cutter. The gradient heights of the boards were 
            calculated with parabolic and sine functions. Arranging the characters in chronological order from the oldest 
            forms to the ones we see today, I portrayed the evolution of the Dragon. Utilizing the transparency of 
            acrylic boards, I installed a light tube in the base. The light refracted and outlined the edges of the characters, 
            giving the Dragon a mythic glow.

          <p>In computer science, infinite loops are often undesired as they prevent programs from reaching their ends. 
            This three-dimensional portrait of me has wood veneers looped around a 
            head and is a metaphor for problems I encounter both in coding and in life. The whirl extending above represents 
            my continuous discoveries and attempts to break free from the infinite loop.

          <p>Zeros and ones are the binary digits, the building blocks of computer software, a subject of my interest. 
            In this Styrofoam sculpture, I mirrored my upper body vertically, transformed it into zeros and ones, and 
            arranged them to form the reflection of my head, similar to a flower blossoming with ideas. At the back of 
            the sculpture, I carved holes shaped like stairs leading up to doors. These voids were inspired by the 
            staircases in Egyptian pyramids, and they symbolize secret paths that lead to my inner thoughts.

          <p>People often try to overcome obstacles in life, which I interpret as one sprinting hard. 
            I chose to visualize my interpretation using pencils, a material that I have been using since childhood. 
            I cut pencils in different lengths and stacked them to form an athlete sprinting with speed and fluidity. 
            In doing so, I encourage everyone to sprint with energy to conquer barriers in their lives.

          <p>In this sculpture, I hope to express my fondness for music and my violin, which has accompanied me 
            through nearly a decade of practiceing the instrument. Using cardboard, I put together a violin in a one to one ratio, 
            and divided it into segments that appear to be floating and dancing to a melody. The 
            irregular shape of the violin imbues it with a sense of movement. Finally, 
            I covered the violin's surface with sheet music in order to further emphasize its musicality.

          <p>This is a work of Chinese calligraphy, the art of writing Chinese characters. With a 
            brush and ink on Xuan paper, I wrote two poems composed by one of my favorite poets, Bai Juyi, 
            describing his reunion with a friend and the beautiful landscapes of his hometown. Focusing on the 
            aesthetics of calligraphy, I wanted to show my dedication to mastering this art and acknowledge my ties 
            to Chinese traditions.

          <h3><a href="art-images/landscape-full.JPG">Landscape Rhythms</a></h3>
          <p><i><b>Date:</b> April 2017</i></p>
          <p><i><b>Materials:</b> Chinese Ink, Xuan Paper, Transparent Film, White-Out, Acrylic Paint</i></p>
          <p><i><b>Dimensions:</b> W 31.5" x D 1.4" x H 30.3</i></p>
          <p>In this work, I portrayed traditional Chinese landscape paintings in new ways. First, I reversed 
            one of my calligraphic works, printed it onto a transparent film, and attached
            it to the back of two of my Chinese ink paintings. Then, 
            I cut out shapes of rocks. To create a sense of depth, I 
            arranged them on three transparent films and drew elements of Chinese landscape paintings—mountains and a waterfall—rendering a multi-layer landscape with the cutouts, white-out, and 
            acrylic paint. Shining light through the work, I let the calligraphy transcend 
            above the earth and become visible from the front. The rhythmic Chinese verses, read from top to bottom, echo the 
            flowing waterfall. This work, as a result, links the past to the present, acknowledging both my cultural traditions 
            and contemporary mixed-media techniques.
